ApesMapper
=========

app start
----------
rackup

run console
-----------
irb -r ./apes_mapper.rb

*extra*

if you want to change application style you will need compass: (probably you need to install ruby and gem before this)

    $ gem install compass
    $ gem install html5-boilerplate
    

and then:

    $ cd app && compass watch

it will compile every change you do in css_src folder css files
